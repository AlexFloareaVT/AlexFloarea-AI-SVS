# AlexFloarea-AI-SVS
The core dataset used in AI SVS Model Training for "Alex Floarea"

This is the core English dataset for the Alex Floarea AI SVS Dataset

This dataset contains roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes of British English singing data in WAV format with phoneme level HTK style labelling.
Phonemes are labelled according to ARPA English phonemes, with additions of dx, ax, N and M.
All audio in this dataset was recorded using a Blue Yeti, and most samples have been treated with a noise gate and limiter.
This dataset was not sung by a professional singer, so the singing quality is poor but covers a large range.

-You **MAY** use this dataset and it's labels for MultiSpeaker training of AI SVS Models  
-You **MAY** use this dataset and it's labels for research purposes  
-You **MAY** use this dataset and it's labels to create your own dataset through SVC methods, but you **MUST** credit me, AlexFloareaVT, for the dataset's origins.  
-You **MAY** use this dataset and it's labels to train an AI SVS Model for platforms this vocal is not currently available for but distribution of the model itself is forbidden unless I explicitly give permission or you ask me to distribute it on your behalf. You will be credited for the training.  

-You **MAY NOT** use this dataset and it's labels for MultiSpeaker training if it contains any datasets created from Celebrity vocals, UTAU voicebanks, or any other datasets that you do not have the rights/permissions to use for AI training.  
-You **MAY NOT** use this dataset and it's labels to create your own dataset through SVC methods that use Celebrity vocals, UTAU voicebanks, or any other datasets that you do not have the rights/permissions to use for AI training.  
-You **MAY NOT** use this dataset's audio to create an AI SVC model of Alex Floarea unless I explicitly give permission, but distribution of the resulting model will be forbidden.  
-You **MAY NOT** use this dataset and it's labels to train an AI SVS Model for platforms this vocal is currently available for, unless the resulting model you're training will improve upon the quality of the original. Distribution of the resulting model is forbidden  
 unless you ask me to distribute it on your behalf as an official release. Credit will be given to you for the updated model. Training a model of this voice for practice or educational purposes is allowed.
